# Nimlings

Learn the Nim programming language by fixing broken programs.

The current Nim documentation is in depth and comprehensive, but for newcomers it's a bit 
suffocating and hard to know where you need to go next.

It's my sincere hope that this project gets more people interested in Nim!

### Goals

- Learn how to read and write Nim by fixing tiny programs.
- Real life Nim situations you'll see in normal day to day Nim work.
- Covers the 80% of Nim you'll see the majority of the time. 
  - If you need to learn the other 20%, we'll provide good sources to dive deep.
