# Nimlings

Learn the Nim programming language by fixing broken programs.

The current Nim documentation is in depth and comprehensive, but for newcomers it's a bit 
suffocating and hard to know where you need to go next.

It's my sincere hope that this project gets more people interested in Nim!

### Goals

- Learn how to read and write Nim by fixing tiny programs.
- Real life Nim situations you'll see in normal day to day Nim work.
- Covers the 80% of Nim you'll see the majority of the time. 
  - If you need to learn the other 20%, we'll provide good sources to dive deep.

### Exercises

- [x] Hello world
- [x] Assignments
- [x] If conditionals
### Usage Guide

You only need to have Nim 1.4.2 and Nimble installed to run all the Nimlings.

Use `nimble run` in the terminal to run all your exercises. Exercises are
run sequentially and if one fails the others are halted. Give it a try.

Failure is the goal here, by failing and fixing the programs you will learn
how Nim works and how to leverage `nimble` to run your projects.
